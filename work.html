                        <h4>Vector Self-Portrait</h4>
                        <p>Our first major project in Graphic Design was to create a self-portrait using some of the techniques we learned in Adobe Illustrator, such as the Pen Tool, Eyedropper, and Paint Bucket Tool. This self-portrait designed by Emerald was submitted to the ACA World Championship and she won and competed in the competition in Dallas, TX.</p>

                        <h4>Color Schemes Group Project</h4>
                        <p>Students learned color schemes and how to use Corel Painter. The students were split into groups and had to paint a section of a photo they chose using a different color scheme. The painting had to use a combination of warm, cool, analogous, and complementary colors.</p>

                        <h4>Photoshop Project</h4>
                        <p>In this Photoshop Project, students learned the basics of photoshop by refining a magazine by using non-destructive editing techniques and adding text to a document.</p>

                        <h4>Creative Typography</h4>
                        <p>This typography project required students to learn all of the terminology related to typography and then research a font of their choice. The students then had to create a presentation of the font and cover all of the font’s characteristics and uses. Finally, students needed to create a creative project related to the font to showcase its potential.</p>

                        <p>This poster was created for the 2015 Brian Head Arts Festival. Students researched the iconic Brian Head landmarks and the festival itself to see what it offered. We had to create something that really embodied the spirit of Brian Head, the national park in Utah. This art won first place, this poster was created and designed by Keena Venegas.</p>

                        <h4>Mixed Color Schemes</h4>
                        <p>A digital painting created from a reference photo. Rather than using the standard colors of the photo, the piece is broken up into different color schemes, such as monochromatic, complementary, and analogous. This project helped the students learn more about color theory, which colors worked well together and which didn't. This project was created and designed by Cynthia Kar.</p>

                        <h4>Infographic</h4>
                        <p>This was an assignment for our Graphic Design II class. Working in a group of two we had to create an infographic for a topic of our choosing. This group decided on Apple's timeline of their products. This was a great way to refresh our knowledge on Illustrator and help us get better. It was enjoyable to create icons and see the whole project come together.  We were able to see how well we worked in teams as well. This project was created and designed by Demitri Bannoura and Jasmine Phat.</p>

                        <h4>Sketchbook Project</h4>
                        <p>This is a project that focused us on the usage of a sketchbook. Students had to develop a theme and do research in order to create a final piece. The theme Solange chose was touch. Solange chose touch because of the different directions she could go with. She went with intimacy and lack of it, as represented with the colors. She used Sketchbook Pro for this painting; this project was created and designed by Solange Nhan.</p>

                        <p>For junior year we had a client looking for a new logo for Marketing Education. This is a logo made for the 80 Years of Marketing Education. Students had to learn exactly the meaning behind of "what is a logo?" and how to showcase Marketing Education. This logo, made by Keena, who won the competition.</p>
