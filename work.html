                        <p>Students learned color schemes and how to use Corel Painter. The students were split into groups and had to paint a section of a photo they chose using a different color scheme. The painting had to use a combination of warm, cool, analogous, and complementary colors.</p>

                        <p>This typography project required students to learn all of the terminology related to typography and then research a font of their choice. The students then had to create a presentation of the font and cover all of the font’s characteristics and uses. Finally, students needed to create a creative project related to the font to showcase its potential.</p>

Rather than using the standard colors of the photo, the piece is broken up into different color schemes, such as monochromatic, complementary, and analogous. This project helped the students learn more about color theory, which colors worked well together and which didn't. This project was created and designed by Cynthia Kar.</p>

                        <p>This was an assignment for our Graphic Design II class. Working in a group of two we had to create an infographic for a topic of our choosing. This group decided on Apple's timeline of their products. This was a great way to refresh our knowledge on Illustrator and help us get better. It was enjoyable to create icons and see the whole project come together.  We were able to see how well we worked in teams as well. This project was created and designed by Demitri Bannoura and Jasmine Phat.</p>

                        <p>This is a project that focused us on the usage of a sketchbook. Students had to develop a theme and do research in order to create a final piece. The theme Solange chose was touch. Solange chose touch because of the different directions she could go with. She went with intimacy and lack of it, as represented with the colors. She used Sketchbook Pro for this painting; this project was created and designed by Solange Nhan.</p>
